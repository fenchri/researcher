I am a Research Scientist at [Huawei Noah's Ark](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home) lab based in London. 

My current interests involve the intersection of natural language with programming languages and how we can develop models that can effectively handle both. I am also interested in how to use data effeciently to better train models, for instance via curriculum learning techniques. 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [NaCTeM](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/) group of the [University of Manchester](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/), where I also obtained my PhD, advised by Prof. [Sophia Ananiadou](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/staff/sophia.ananiadou). During this time, I was also fortunate to work with Prof. [Makoto Miwa](https://www.toyota-ti.ac.jp/Lab/Denshi/COIN/people/makoto.miwa/). My research focused mainly on information extraction by recognising relations between named entities within and across sentences in fully- and distantly-supervised settings.

Prior to my PhD, I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) (BEng & MSc).
